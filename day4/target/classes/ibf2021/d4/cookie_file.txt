The love of your life is right in front of your eyes.
Behind this fortune is the love of my life.
You have a secret admirer.
Love, because it is the only true adventure.
The love of your life will appear in front of you unexpectedly!
An old love will come back to you.
The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese.
Be on the alert to recognize your prime at whatever time of your life it may occur.
Your road to glory will be rocky, but fulfilling.
Courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point.
Nothing is impossible to a willing heart.
Dont pursue happiness create it.
The real kindness comes from within you.
The usefulness of a cup is in its emptiness.
To avoid criticism, do nothing, say nothing, be nothing.
Of all our human resources, the most precious is the desire to improve.
Success lies in the hands of those who wants it.
